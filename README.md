## File Structure
```
Dashboard/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css      # CSS styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js       # JavaScript functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # This file
```

## Customization

### Adding New Search Engines
To add a new search engine, edit the `search()` function in `script.js`:

```javascript
case 'newengine':
    searchUrl = `https://newengine.com/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;
    break;
```

Then add a button in `index.html`:

```html
<button onclick="search('newengine')" class="search-btn newengine-btn">
    <i class="fas fa-search"></i> New Engine
</button>
```

### Changing Colors
The app uses CSS custom properties for easy color customization. Edit the gradient values in `styles.css`:

```css
body {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #your-color-1 0%, #your-color-2 100%);
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Weather Not Loading
- Make sure you've allowed location access in your browser
- Check your internet connection
- The weather service may be temporarily unavailable

### Data Not Saving
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Check if localStorage is available (most modern browsers support it)

### Mobile Issues

- Landscape mode works best on tablets

## Privacy
